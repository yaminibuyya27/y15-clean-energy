    <p>
      This line chart illustrates the growth of renewable energy capacity across major global regions from 2020 to 2024,
      derived from the IEA Renewables analysis and forecast. The data is measured in megawatts (MW) and shows the total
      installed renewable energy capacity for each region. According to the IEA report, Asia-Pacific leads in absolute
      capacity due to China and India's large-scale solar and wind installations, with China alone accounting for a
      significant portion of global renewable additions. Europe shows steady growth driven by offshore wind development
      and solar expansion, particularly in Germany and Spain. North America displays consistent growth in both utility-scale
      solar and wind projects, supported by policy incentives. Latin America demonstrates accelerating growth, primarily
      from wind and hydroelectric projects. The Middle East & Africa region shows emerging growth in solar capacity,
      driven by desert solar farms and government renewable energy initiatives. This regional analysis, based on IEA data,
      helps identify global trends and highlights where clean energy adoption is most rapidly advancing through 2028.
