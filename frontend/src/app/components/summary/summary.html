    <p>
      This chart displays the global investment trends in clean energy technologies from 2020 to 2024,
      based on data from the IEA Renewables report. The visualization shows investment amounts in billions
      of USD across different renewable energy sectors including Solar, Wind, Hydro, and Energy Storage.
      According to the IEA analysis, solar energy has consistently attracted the highest investments,
      reflecting the technology's improving cost-effectiveness and widespread adoption. Wind energy
      follows closely, with significant growth driven by offshore wind development. Energy storage
      investments have surged in recent years, supporting grid stability and electric vehicle adoption.
      Hydroelectric power maintains steady investment levels as a mature renewable technology. The data
      demonstrates a clear upward trajectory in clean energy investments, with total renewable energy
      investment projected to reach over $630 billion by 2024, indicating strong market confidence and
      policy support for the global energy transition described in the IEA forecast.
