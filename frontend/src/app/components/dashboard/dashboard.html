    <p>
      The clean energy sector has experienced remarkable innovations over the past six months, driven by advancements in solar technology, battery storage, and green hydrogen production. Recent developments in perovskite solar cells have achieved record efficiencies exceeding 33%, promising more cost-effective solar power generation. Meanwhile, solid-state batteries are emerging as game-changers for electric vehicles, offering higher energy density and improved safety compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries. Green hydrogen, produced through renewable energy-powered electrolysis, is gaining traction as a clean fuel alternative for heavy industries and transportation. Furthermore, offshore wind technology has seen significant improvements with floating turbines capable of operating in deeper waters, unlocking vast new energy resources. Smart grid technologies incorporating AI and machine learning are optimizing energy distribution and reducing waste. Carbon capture and storage innovations are also advancing, with direct air capture facilities scaling up operations. These breakthroughs collectively represent a transformative period for the clean energy industry, accelerating the global transition toward sustainable energy systems and helping address climate change challenges.

    <h2 id="technical-heading">Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>
      This application is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using Angular 21 for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. The backend runs on port 3000 and uses MySQL database with three tables: users (for authentication), energy_investments, and regional_capacity (for chart data). User registration and login functionality is implemented with secure password encryption using bcrypt (10 salt rounds), storing all credentials in the database rather than environment variables. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for stateless authentication, with tokens validated on each protected endpoint. The frontend communicates with the backend through HTTP REST APIs using Angular's HttpClient service, fetching chart data asynchronously to populate dynamic visualizations. Chart.js library renders interactive bar charts on the Summary and Reports pages. The application follows accessibility best practices (WCAG guidelines) including semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support, and proper focus management. Auth guards protect routes requiring authentication. Nginx serves the frontend on port 80 in production, while the backend operates independently as a REST API service. The project is version-controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub.
